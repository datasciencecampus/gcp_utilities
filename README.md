# Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Utilities and Example Code
Useful generic code to interact with Cloud Native tools on Google Cloud Platform, includes  functions that could be used in Cloud Functions and Cloud Run to interact with

- [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery) 
- [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage)
- [Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub)
- [FireStore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore)

The Python code builds on the https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client library, but wraps some common functions for easier error handling and logging to StackDriver. This can make developing and working wih Cloud Functions much easier.
